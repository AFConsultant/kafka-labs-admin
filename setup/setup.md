You can run the lab...

* on GitHub  (using `codespaces`)

## Running on GitHub Codespaces

### Prerequisites

* Go to the project on GitHub : https://github.com/AFConsultant/kafka-labs-admin
* Click on Code > Codespaces
* Create a new Codespace by clicking on the three dots and selecting `4-core` as Maching Type.
* You should have 30 free hours per month.

### Configuration

* Run the following scripts to setup the network and your CLI.
```sh
ansible-playbook ansible/main.yml
```
* Open a new terminal
* Test that your Kafka commands are working:
```sh
kafka-topics.sh
```
This should show the kafka-topics documentation:
```txt
